# GANBased-Video-Enhancement
A powerful and easy-to-use deep learning-based tool to upscale low-resolution videos using advanced super-resolution models: ESRGAN (Enhanced Super-Resolution GAN) and SRGAN (Super-Resolution GAN). This project turns blurry or pixelated videos into high-quality, sharper versions â€” perfect for anime upscaling, restoration, or old footage enhancement.

ESRGAN (Enhanced Super-Resolution GAN)
Uses RRDB (Residual-in-Residual Dense Blocks) for powerful feature learning
Excellent for detailed image textures, anime, and real-world images

Handles 4x upscaling by default

SRGAN (Super-Resolution GAN)
First GAN-based model for image super-resolution
Slightly lighter, but faster and still produces good results
Useful when resources are limited or speed is important
